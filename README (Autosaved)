# cat-blur

Demo available at http://jamesmoss.co.uk/cat-blur/

Simulating a blur effect using javascript to fade between sharp and blurred copies of a single image.

Move your mouse to the right in the browser window to increase blur; left to decrease.

This effect could be improved by making the fading algorithm logarithmic to stop the image from going too transparent during animation.
